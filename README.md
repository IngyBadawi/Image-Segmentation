# Image-Segmentation

* Trying to solve the image segmenation problem using K-means algorithm for various K values.
* Encoded the spatial layout of the pixels and reapplied K-Means algorithm and compared it to the previous result
* The result segmentation of the K-Means is evaluated using F-measure, Conditional Entropy for image I with M available ground-truth segmentations.
* Clustering using the Normalised Cut for the 5-NN graph is also used and compared to the result of the K-Means algorithm.

# Dataset
* Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark
